The Spanish civil war confrontated the Replubican goverment and the insurgent
nationalist forces. Becoming in fact the prelude of the WWII conflict, several
foreigns got quickly involved, on one hand because political reasons, but also
to test the new war machinery and tactics.

## Strengths

While insurgents have got control of a significant part of the land army, Naval
officers are still loyal to the Republica, which gives us some advantage along
sea.

Also, URSS is providing the best available armoured vehicles, which clearly
has not counterpart in the insurgent lines.

## Weakness

The artillery pieces salvaged by the Republica are outdated, and quite low
in number.

URSS is providing some material to the air battlefield. However, insurgents are
clearly in advantage along air, thanks to the help of Italy and Germany.]],
